# Packet-Tracer-Labs
<h4> Purpose: These labs are different networking scenarios that I have come up with that mixes and matches the material that is tested on the CCNA exam. 
 I created them with instructions for others that want to complete them as well. </h4>

<h4>1) The packet tracer lab that is titled</h4>
   
  ```etherchannel load balancing, redundancy and increased bandwidth.pkt``` 
    
<h4>is a theoretical lab, packet tracer is not a perfect software solution and it will sometimes complete a traceroute but other times not as it tries its best to EMULATE hardware, however on real hardware it should work 100% of the time in more complicated networks.</h4>

<h4>2) The packet tracer lab that is titled</h4>

```NTP start.pkt```
<h4>Is a limited functionality lab because packet tracer does not include certain functions/commands in or related to the NTP suite such as the NTP source command and the show calendar command.</h4>
