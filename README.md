# Packet-Tracer-Labs
<h4> Purpose: These labs are different networking scenarios that I have come up with that mixes and matches the material that is tested on the CCNA exam. 
 I created them with instructions for others that want to complete them as well. </h4>

<h4>1) The packet tracer lab that is titled</h4>
   
  ```etherchannel load balancing, redundancy and increased bandwidth.pkt``` 
    
<h4>Is a theoretical lab, packet tracer is not a perfect software solution and it will sometimes complete a traceroute but other times not as it tries its best to EMULATE hardware, however on real hardware it should work 100% of the time in more complicated networks.</h4>

<h4>2) The packet tracer lab that is titled</h4>

```NTP start.pkt```
<h4>Is a limited functionality lab because packet tracer does not include certain functions/commands in or related to the NTP suite such as the NTP source command and the show calendar command.</h4>
<br>
<h4>3) The packet tracer lab that is titled</h4>

```DNS server & DNS router config.pkt```
<h4>Is a limited functionality lab because packet tracer does not include the "ip DNS server" command in global config mode so routers cannot be configured to act as a DNS server for clients. However they can still build a host name list and resolve host-names to ip addresses by checking their local entries before executing a command such as a ping to a client per the manually entered hostname.</h4>

<h4>4) The packet tracer lab that is titled</h4>

```SNMP Start.pkt``` 
<h4>Is a very limited functionality lab because packet tracer does not include a great deal of commands related to SNMP, for instance, the 'SNMP-server host' command is left out meaning you cannot configure a SNMP notification host server to receive traps or request messages. However, communities can still be formed and endhosts can use the MIB browser to use get, getbulk and set messages, as well as view a variety of details about devices within the communities you will configure in the lab. Therefore, I included a SNMP lab despite it missing a whole bunch of commands/features, also, I included it because it's a commonly used protocol on modern networks.</h4>

<h4>4) The packet tracer lab that is titled</h4>

```SSH, Telnet, RSA key generation, port-security, VTY line config, username and password protection.done```
<h4>Uses CCNP for the command line secret on the switches and Jeff for the secret to access privileged exec mode. The username is Steven.</h4>
